Tulsa Road Issues Feed
======================
The Tulsa Road Issues Feed (TRIF) aggregates road information from several sources into a single feed.  This can be used by media outlets to report issues to their audience, or as the raw data for interactive web projects.

This project is part of [Hackathon 2011](http://tulsahackathon.com/2011/).  See our [github project](https://github.com/tulsawebdevs/tulsa-road-issues-feed) for up-to-date information.
